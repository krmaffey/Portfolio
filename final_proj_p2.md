# Final Project, Part 2
This assignment continues the process of constructing and refining the narrative and structure of our final projects.

## Wireframe and storyboard
I constructed my wireframe and storyboard using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio) for the wireframes and [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/organisations/JSrgFWI7zn) for the storyboard. 

I knew I wanted to get some time using Shorthand, so I decided to use it starting in this phase of the final project. I had an idea of what charts were important to my project, and I knew generally what my narrative was going to be. I found it challenging to portray the data in creative ways; I found myself constantly moving to use bar and line charts because those tend to be easy to grok, and my data is mostly in aggregate form.

As I was crafting my wireframes, I ran into some issues on both the data and formatting fronts. For data, I wanted to examine multiple years of conflict data but my account was temporarily blocked because I hadn't received prior permission from ACLED and I had reached the level of allowed downloads for non-academic accounts. I was able to rectify this after a few days, but once I got access I found out they don't have data for two of the three countries for the timeframe I wanted to look at.

On formatting, I couldn't figure out how to label a line in Flourish for a bar chart. And lo and behold, one of my participants asked what the bar was meant to represent.

## User Research and Interviews
#### Goals and Metrics
Goal: Evaluate effectiveness of graphs<br>
Question: Can someone with no background in this area gain an understanding from this website?<br>
Goal: Determine if call to action is relatable<br>
Question: Does this page make people want to do something?
#### Metrics:
- Whether participants understand what the site is about
- Whether participants take away some statistics or facts
- Whether participants seem engaged/excited to learn more 

### Target Audience
The goal of my project is to raise awareness of international issues of women's rights in the Middle East. I hope to reach an audience of my peers, because I've found that American literacy of international issues tends to be limited unless they have traveled or worked abroad. As such, I'm looking to appeal to Americans between the ages of about 20 and 40 who are engaged in politics and/or international affairs. My hope is that in understanding the data presented in my project, they can use their voices to consider all parties who need attention on a global stage.
### Approach to Identifying Interviewees
My target audience is very accessible to me since many of my friends and family fall into this group. I asked for feedback from people who had some experiences internationally and people who didn't, in the hope that I could make my project compelling to a wide set of people.
### Interview Script
#### Introduction
Hi thanks for taking time to give feedback on my visualization project. My goal today is to evaluate what makes sense and what’s confusing. Everything we discuss will be anonymized, and this feedback session will take less than 10 minutes of your time.
#### Main Section
1. Can you tell me in your own words what you think this site is for?
2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
3. Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?
4. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
6. What other questions do you have about this site, if any?

#### Wrap up
Thank you so much for your time! Do you have any questions for me?

### Interview Results

Before starting my user interviews, I got to a point where I was comfortable with several of my wireframes via Flourish and arranged them in a manner that was similar to the structure I had proposed in the [first part](/final_proj_p1.md) of this project. However, I still felt like my narrative was lacking so I decided to get some of my feedback and then address it again.

#### Feedback from Person 1 (Profile: female, educated to a master's level, age 25)
_What do you think this site is for?_<br>
"To raise money/awareness for organizations trying to improve the treatment of women in Middle Eastern countries"<br>
_Describe what the site is telling you_<br>
"There is more reported violence against women than there are people who are willing to say that they support it"<br>
_Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?_<br>
"WASPs"<br>
_Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?_<br>
"The phrase 'conflict events' is confusing. Also, you should clarify if it's just men or both men and women who responded to the survey stating that it's okay for a man to beat his female relatives"<br>
_Is there anything you would change or do differently?_<br>
"Make the wording more succinct and darken the font of the country names on the x axis of the graphics so they are more readable"<br>

#### Feedback from Person 2 (Profile: male, educated to a bachelor's level, age 27)
_What do you think this site is for?_<br>
"To help the layperson understand the current situation for women's rights in the Middle East, the importance of their continued amelioration, and then a call to action to make sure there's more data to help rectify the situation"<br>
_Describe what the site is telling you_<br>
"That in a lot of Middle Eastern countries there are some clear areas in which women are suffering, especially the large percentages that think that it's okay for men to hit women. Also that the labor force participation ratio is unequal for men and women. And that there is a correlation between trends in conflict data and in the percentage of people who think it's okay for men to hit women"<br>
_Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?_<br>
"Probably a western, educated audience; people who might be in a position to donate money or time or advocate on behalf of women in the Middle East"<br>
_Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?_<br>
"I was surprised by the rate of intimate partner violence generally and also surprised that the trend between conflict events and women's rights was so pronounced"<br>
_Is there anything you would change or do differently?_<br>
"Feature the organizations doing the work earlier in the presentation"<br>

#### Changes I made
- Reduced the amount of text on the site
- Featured the women's organizations earlier in the narrative
- Changed formatting in some of the visualizations

#### Feedback from Person 3 (Profile: male, educated to a PhD level, age 26)
_What do you think this site is for?_<br>
"It shows statistics regarding abuse to women in Middle Eastern countries"<br>
_Describe what the site is telling you_<br>
"This site is telling me about organizations in those countries that support women as well as laws and cultural practices that hinder their advancement"<br>
_Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?_<br>
"People looking to learn more about women's rights around the world, specifically focused on the Middle east. But anyone interested in women's rights would find this site useful."<br>
_Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?_<br>
"Nothing confusing; surprising were the statistics on the rate of people that thought it was okay to beat women"<br>
_Is there anything you would change or do differently?_<br>
"I would pick other countries to highlight in the first graphic, to give perspective. In the second graphic, I would make the three focus countries more easily distinguishable and make the background countries lighter. You should stipulate what you mean by "female relatives" and "intimate partners" in the two graphs. Also add a transition before the last graphic."<br>

#### Changes I made
- Changed wording and added clarification of data sources regarding what is meant by the terms used in the graphics (female relative, intimate partner)
- Added a transition before the last graphic

#### Feedback from my group in class
My group in class made some helpful comments about possibilities for referencing foundations or think tanks in addition to requesting that the OECD and the WHO collect better data on violence against women. They also showed me how to put in names for the numbered navigation categories in Shorthand, and while I quickly implemented some categories I think those need to be refined. They suggested that I pick colors that are more distinguishable from one another in all of the graphs, as they said it was hard to follow which country was which. Finally, we spent some time discussing the graphic that focuses on Egypt, and they agreed that there might be a better way to depict that data rather than a bar and line chart.

### Changes to be Implemented
- Adjust graphics so that country names are darker, but background countries are lighter. Consider adding reference countries to the graphic about attitudes towards violence against women
- Consider changing the transition before the last graphic
- Research think tanks/foundations that might fund the collection of data on violence against women
- Refine navigation categories
- Make colors more differentiable on all graphics
- Explore other formats for the graphics on conflict and attitudes toward violence against women

I'm looking forward to pulling all of this together for the presentation next week!
