# Final Project, Part 2
This assignment continues the process of constructing and refining the narrative and structure of our final projects.

## Wireframe and storyboard
I constructed my wireframe and storyboard using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio) for the wireframes and [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/organisations/JSrgFWI7zn) for the storyboard.

## User Research and Interviews
#### Goals and Metrics
Goal: Evaluate effectiveness of graphs
Question: can someone with no background in this area gain an understanding from this website?
Goal: Determine if call to action is relatable
Question: does this page make people want to do something?
#### Metrics:
- Whether participants understand what the site is about
- Whether participants seem engaged/excited to learn more 
- Whether participants are willing to do something in response to the call to action
### Target Audience
The goal of my project is to raise awareness of international issues of women's rights in the Middle East. I hope to reach an audience of my peers, because I've found that American literacy of international issues tends to be limited unless they have traveled or worked abroad. As such, I'm looking to appeal to Americans between the ages of about 20 and 40 who are engaged in politics and/or international affairs. My hope is that in understanding the data presented in my project, they can use their engagement and voices to consider all parties who need attention on a global stage.
### Approach to Identifying Interviewees
My target audience is very accessible to me since most of my friends and family fall into this group. I thought through asking some people who had some experiences internationally and some who didn't, in hopes that I could make my project compelling to a wider set of people.
