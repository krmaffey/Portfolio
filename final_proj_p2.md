# Final Project, Part 2
This assignment continues the process of constructing and refining the narrative and structure of our final projects.

## Wireframe and storyboard
I constructed my wireframe and storyboard using [Flourish](https://flourish.studio) for the wireframes and [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/organisations/JSrgFWI7zn) for the storyboard. 

I knew I wanted to get some time using Shorthand, so I decided to use it starting in this phase of the final project. I had an idea of what charts were important to my project, and I knew generally what my narrative was going to be. I found it challenging to portray the data in creative ways; I found myself constantly moving to use bar and line charts because those tend to be easy to grok, and my data is mostly in aggregate form.

As I was crafting my wireframes, I ran into some issues on both the data and formatting fronts. For data, I wanted to examine multiple years of conflict data but my account was temporarily blocked because I hadn't received prior permission from ACLED and I had reached the level of allowed downloads for non-academic accounts. I was able to rectify this after a few days, but once I got access I found out they don't have data for two of the three countries for the timeframe I wanted to look at.

On formatting, I couldn't figure out how to label a line in Flourish for a bar chart. And lo and behold, one of my participants asked what the bar was meant to represent.

Here's a sneak peak of one of the incredible photos I found on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/egypt?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText); head over to [Shorthand](https://shorthand.com/organisations/JSrgFWI7zn) to see all my wireframes embedded in my storyboard!

## User Research and Interviews
#### Goals and Metrics
Goal: Evaluate effectiveness of graphs
Question: can someone with no background in this area gain an understanding from this website?
Goal: Determine if call to action is relatable
Question: does this page make people want to do something?
#### Metrics:
- Whether participants understand what the site is about
- Whether participants seem engaged/excited to learn more 
- Whether participants are willing to do something in response to the call to action

### Target Audience
The goal of my project is to raise awareness of international issues of women's rights in the Middle East. I hope to reach an audience of my peers, because I've found that American literacy of international issues tends to be limited unless they have traveled or worked abroad. As such, I'm looking to appeal to Americans between the ages of about 20 and 40 who are engaged in politics and/or international affairs. My hope is that in understanding the data presented in my project, they can use their engagement and voices to consider all parties who need attention on a global stage.
### Approach to Identifying Interviewees
My target audience is very accessible to me since most of my friends and family fall into this group. I thought through asking some people who had some experiences internationally and some who didn't, in hopes that I could make my project compelling to a wider set of people.
### Interview Script
#### Introduction
Hi my name is Kate and I'm working on a visualization project. My goal today is to get feedback on the project in order to evaluate what makes sense and what’s confusing. Everything we discuss will be anonymizes, and this feedback session will take less than 10 minutes of your time.
#### Main Section
1. Can you tell me in your own words what you think this site is for?
2. Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
3. Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?
4. Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
5. Is there anything you would change or do differently?
6. What other questions do you have about this site, if any?

#### Wrap up
Thank you so much for your time! Do you have any questions for me?

### Interview Results
#### Feedback from Person 1 (Profile: female, educated to a master's level, age 25)
_What do you think this site is for?_<br>
"To raise money/awareness for organizations trying to improve the treatment of women in Middle Eastern countries"<br>
_Describe what the site is telling you_<br>
"There is more reported violence against women than there are people who are willing to say that they support it"<br>
_Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?_<br>
"WASPs"<br>
_Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?_<br>
"The phrase 'conflict events' is confusing; you should clarify if it's just men or both men and women who responded to the survey stating that it's okay for a man to beat his female relatives"<br>
_Is there anything you would change or do differently?_<br>
"Make the wording more succinct and darken the font of the country names on the x axis"<br>

#### Feedback from Person 2 (Profile: male, educated to a bachelor's level, age 27)
_What do you think this site is for?_<br>
"To help the layperson understand the current situation for women's rights in the Middle East, the importance of their continued amelioration, and then a call to action to make sure there's more data to help rectify the situation"<br>
_Describe what the site is telling you_<br>
"That in a lot of Middle Eastern countries there are some clear areas in which women are suffering, especially the large percentages that think that it's okay for men to hit women. Also that the labor force participation ratio is unequal for men and women. And that there is a correlation between trends in conflict data and in the percentage of people who think it's okay for men to hit women"<br>
_Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?_<br>
"Probably a western, educated audience; people who might be in a position to donate money or time or advocate on behalf of women in the Middle East"<br>
_Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?_<br>
"I was surprised by the rate of intimate partner violence generally and also surprised that the trend between conflict events and women's rights was so pronounced"<br>
_Is there anything you would change or do differently?_<br>
"Feature the organizations doing the work earlier in the presentation"<br>

#### Changes I made
- Reduced the amount of text on the site
- Featured the women's organizations earlier in the narrative
- Changed some of the visualizations

#### Feedback from Person 3 (Profile: male, educated to a PhD level, age 26)
_What do you think this site is for?_<br>
"It shows statistics regarding abuse to women in Middle Eastern countries"<br>
_Describe what the site is telling you_<br>
"This site is telling me about organizations in those countries that support women as well as laws and cultural practices that hinder their advancement"<br>
_Who do you think the intended audience is for the site?_<br>
"People looking to learn more about women's rights around the world, specifically focused on the Middle east. But anyone interested in women's rights would find this site useful."<br>
_Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?_<br>
"Nothing confusing; surprising were the statistics on the rate of people that thought it was okay to beat women"<br>
_Is there anything you would change or do differently?_<br>
"I would pick other countries to highlight in the first graphic, to give perspective. In the second graphic, I would make the three focus countries more easily distinguishable and make the background countries lighter. You should stipulate what you mean by "female relatives" and "intimate partners" in the two graphs. Also add a transition before the last graphic."<br>

### Changes to be Implemented
- Adjust graphics so that country names are darker
- Add more countries to the graphic on attitudes towards violence against women
- Explain what is meant by "female relatives" and "intimate partners" in two of the graphs
- Add a transition before the last graphic
