# Critique by Design
In this assignment, we selected a visualization to critique and then did so using Stephen Few's Data [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf). We then created a sketch or wireframe of the new visualization, and then solicited feedback on it. The final step was to created a new version of the visualization.

## Step 1: Selecting a Visualization
I found myself drawn to data on women's education and employment, and came across some interesting infographics and visualizations. This one caught my eye in part because it uses color in a way that is very loud, and also in part because I was curious what someone could say with it. I found myself fascinated by the idea of portraying multiple variables over time - in this case, occupation types and racial identity of women across several decades. After some time looking at this visualization, I had to look at the written commentary that went with it in order to understand the point that the author was making. I found myself thinking that there should be a way to create those takeaways visually, which made me want to use this graphic for this assignment.

## Step 2: Critiquing the Visualization
This step was straightforward for me because I spent a fair bit of time looking at the visualization before I decided to use it. The color was the most prominent part that I focused on in my critique, as well as choosing a comparison tool (a stacked bar chart) that made it hard to distinguish comparison and change over time.

## Step 3: Wireframing a Solution
I spent a lot of time on finding data that I could use as the original data source did not work for me. As such, I spent a lot of time thinking about how the data should be structured and aggregated and then implemented. I found it hard to show even a portion of the datat that was shown in the original visualization without being overwhelmed. I started breaking out the takeaways in my mind and ended up with this panel of visualizations that each depict one of the takeaways described in the original source's commentary that went with the visualization.
