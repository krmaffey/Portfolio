# Critique by Design
In this assignment, we selected a visualization to critique and then did so using Stephen Few's Data [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf). We then created a sketch or wireframe of the new visualization, and then solicited feedback on it. The final step was to created a new version of the visualization.

## Step 1: Selecting a Visualization
I found myself drawn to data on women's education and employment, and came across some interesting infographics and visualizations. This one caught my eye in part because it uses color in a way that is very loud, and also in part because I was curious what someone could say with it. I found myself fascinated by the idea of portraying multiple variables over time - in this case, occupation types and racial identity of women across several decades. After some time looking at this visualization, I had to look at the written commentary that went with it in order to understand the point that the author was making. I found myself thinking that there should be a way to create those takeaways visually, which made me want to use this graphic for this assignment.

I did run into some data snafus, and as such took a bit of license with the dates depicted by the graphic. I was unable to get census data aggregated in the same way as the visualization depicts so I found two datasets from 30 years apart that were similarly aggregated. Even with the datasets I found, I had to do extensive data cleaning and sorting to be able to build a solution that clearly showed the takeaways that the original visualization's author described in the written portion of their website.

## Step 2: Critiquing the Visualization
This step was straightforward for me because I spent a fair bit of time looking at the visualization before I decided to use it. The color was the most prominent part that I focused on in my critique, as well as choosing a comparison tool (a stacked bar chart) that made it hard to distinguish comparison and change over time.

## Step 3: Wireframing a Solution
I spent a lot of time on finding data that I could use as the original data source did not work for me. As such, I spent a lot of time thinking about how the data should be structured and aggregated and then implemented. I found it hard to show even a portion of the datat that was shown in the original visualization without being overwhelmed. I started breaking out the takeaways in my mind and ended up with this panel of visualizations that each depict one of the takeaways described in the original source's commentary that went with the visualization.

## Step 4: Testing the Solution
 I solicited feedback on this wireframe from 3 people, which was very helpful. The first person was very caught up with both the lack of color and my poor handwriting, so I preempted the second and third person with those two aspects and found their feedback to be more useful as it went beyond the simplistic limitations of the wireframe method I chose.
 
 All three people immediately recognized that this visualization was depicting changes in women's employment over time, and were able to quickly and clearly articulate that to me. I was very interested by the responses I got when I asked them about the audience - one of them said it seemed intended for equal opportunity employers, one of them said that it was for women who were angry about the lack of progress in the workplace, and the third said it was intended for women because men aren't willing/ready to hear the takeaway of the graph in such a direct way and would prefer to be walked gently to their conclusions.

## Step 5: Building the Solution
