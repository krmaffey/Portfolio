# Critique by Design
In this assignment, we selected a visualization to critique and then did so using Stephen Few's Data [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf). We then created a sketch or wireframe of the new visualization, and then solicited feedback on it. The final step was to created a new version of the visualization.
