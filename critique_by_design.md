# Critique by Design
In this assignment, we selected a visualization to critique and then did so using Stephen Few's Data [Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile](http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf). We then created a sketch or wireframe of the new visualization, and then solicited feedback on it. The final step was to created a new version of the visualization.

## Step 1: Selecting a Visualization
I found myself drawn to data on women's education and employment, and came across some interesting infographics and visualizations. This one caught my eye in part because it uses color in a way that is very loud, and also in part because I was curious what someone could say with it.
