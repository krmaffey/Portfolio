# Final Project, Part 3
This assignment was to finalize our project visualization and presentation!

## Part 1: The Idea
My initial idea for this project was to emphasize the importance of changing laws surrounding women's rights, especially with regards to violence against women, in the Middle East. I wanted to use data on conflict, attitudes about violence against women, and economic participation to do so.

Part 1 included the following:
- A project outline
- A summary of the project
- How my project would be structured
- An explanation of data sources
- Copies of the data I planned to use
- Articulation of method and medium for the project

#### Part 1 can be read in full [here](/final_proj_p1.md)

## Part 2: Design and User Research
In part 2, I implemented my plans to make the visualizations and layout that I proposed in part 1.

Part 2 included the following:
- Wireframes
- A storyboard
- User research protocol
- User interviews
- Findings and updates from user research

## Part 3: Final Data Narrative
This was the last part of our project where we brought everything together. I prepared a site that has all of my graphics and information, and I also created a truncated version of the presentation so that I could easily present it during the one minute we are allocated in class.

#### Changes to graphic details and content
I got several comments from my user research about the graphics themselves, which were useful. Apparently the color scheme I chose made it hard to compare different countries, so I chose a new one using [Colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/) that was more differentiable. I also got comments about how some of the axis colors made it hard to read country names, so I updated those. Finally, I got some comments on my main graphic that it would be useful to get a comparison with some non-Middle Eastern countries. I didn't find a good way to do this on the same graph without it becoming cluttered, so I created two versions of the graph and the user scrolls through them for comparison.

#### Transition Adjustments
Throughout my time doing user reserach and as I worked on this last part, I tried to make my transitions and narrative more cohesive. I realized that there was a way to insert spacers, which is handy. I also tried to pare down the amount of words I used, while still capturing the essence of what I needed to communicate for the narrative to make sense.

#### Research on the Call to Action
My classmates had some great suggestions that would make my first item in the call to action more specific, so I dug into think tanks and foundations that might fund the collection of data on violence against women. Unfortunately I didn't find a lot, but I did uncover the fact that the World Health Organization and the United Nations are conducting a joint program to understand more about what data needs to be collected to help track and end violence against women globally. I linked to this in my call to action, although the program runs from 2018 to 2022 and has not yet published actual data, just recommendations for collecting it. The process made me curious about domestic violence in the U.S., so I researched what the U.S. government does about it. I was surprised that the Office for Violence Against Women had no published datasets on its prevalence, so I made that a note in my call to action for those who want something closer to home.

#### Narrative and Navigation Adjustments
I adjusted my narrative a bit based on user feedback. In addition to including Western countries for comparison with my first graph, I also added in more information about the three countries I chose to highlight. I also made the navigation more intuitive, and made sure my comments flowed throughout the site.

#### Exploring Other Visualization Formats
When discussing the visualizations with my classmates, I specifically asked them about a graphic that showed a comparison of Egypt's conflict events and its attitudes toward violence against women from 2014 to 2019. We discussed finding another form so that the graphic was more informative, and I commented that I found it to be almost "lying with statistics" because it portrayed a trend very clearly even though it was not a lot of data, potentially leading a reader to make causational assumptions. I played around with this graphic a bit but did not find a way to depict it that I felt was forthright, so I ended up deleting the graphic entirely. However, this exploration encouraged me to think about my other graphics and I found a better way to depict my graphic on labor force participation, so it was a good exercise for me in creative thinking about how data can be understood visually.

#### Audience
I identified my audience to be my peers - that is, educated middle class Americans between the ages of 25 and 40. While educated people generally tend to know about themes in parts of the world - i.e. that the Middle East has struggled with women's rights - they tend to not be able to understand the full extent of the ongoing issues. My hope is that this site brings awareness and encourages them to be active in this area, if not regarding the Middle East then engaging in their local communities. I kept this audience in mind throughout the process of creating this site, so most of my decisions revolved around making this information accessible to people like me.

#### Process and Reflections
I really enjoyed the process of creating this site, and found that it was most challenging to visualize the data (versus picking imagery and writing a narrative). Finding the data took some time but was relatively easy - rather, the processing and visualizing of the data was the most difficult part. My data was already aggregated but is a challenging subject so I found myself struggling to keep my visualizations uncluttered. However, I think the product I ended with does communicate things in a clear way despite the challenges I had during the process. I've done user research before but never for visualizations, and I found it very, very useful to get more sets of eyes on my product. I am excited to use the skills I've learned in this course as I move into my next job!
