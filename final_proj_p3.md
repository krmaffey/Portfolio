# Final Project, Part 3
This assignment was to finalize our project visualization and presentation!

## Part 1: The Idea
My initial idea for this project was to emphasize the importance of changing laws surrounding women's rights, especially with regards to violence against women, in the Middle East. I wanted to use data on conflict, attitudes about violence against women, and economic participation to do so.

Part 1 included the following:
- A project outline
- A summary of the project
- How my project would be structured
- An explanation of data sources
- Copies of the data I planned to use
- Articulation of method and medium for the project
#### Part 1 can be read in full [here](/final_proj_p1.md)

## Part 2: Design and User Research
In part 2, I implemented my plans to make the visualizations and layout that I proposed in part 1.

Part 2 included the following:
- Wireframes
- A storyboard
- User research protocol
- User interviews
- Findings and updates from user research

## Part 3: Final Data Narrative
A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)

Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)

Add a link to your final data story (a direct link to Shorthand / StoryMap / etc.) placed in the final presentation spreadsheet.  Add the link next to your name in the spreadsheet, and update the title to reflect the working title for your presentation.  (Part III)

Include all references for materials used.  It's your responsibility to ensure you have permission to use imagery and other assets, and that you use them appropriately.  A reminder to NOT USE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - see the library's guide to ensure you are using images correctly.  Make sure to add / update any citations and / or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.  References should also be clearly identified on your final data story itself.  Review the library's guide if you have questions.

Include any other information that helps round out your data story. (Part III)
