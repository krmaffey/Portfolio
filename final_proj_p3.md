# Final Project, Part 3
This assignment was to finalize our project visualization and presentation!

## Part 1: The Idea
My initial idea for this project was to emphasize the importance of changing laws surrounding women's rights, especially with regards to violence against women, in the Middle East. I wanted to use data on conflict, attitudes about violence against women, and economic participation to do so.

Part 1 included the following:
- A project outline
- A summary of the project
- How my project would be structured
- An explanation of data sources
- Copies of the data I planned to use
- Articulation of method and medium for the project
#### Part 1 can be read in full [here](/final_proj_p1.md)

## Part 2: Design and User Research
In part 2, I implemented my plans to make the visualizations and layout that I proposed in part 1.

Part 2 included the following:
- Wireframes
- A storyboard
- User research protocol
- User interviews
- Findings and updates from user research

## Part 3: Final Data Narrative
#### Changes to graphic details and content
I got several comments from my user research about the graphics themselves, which were useful. Apparently the color scheme I chose made it hard to compare different countries, so I chose a new one using [Colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/) that was more differentiable. I also got comments about how some of the axis colors made it hard to read country names, so I updated those. Finally, I got some comments on my main graphic that it would be useful to get a comparison with some non-Middle Eastern countries. I didn't find a good way to do this on the same graph without it becoming cluttered, so I created two versions of the graph and the user scrolls through them for comparison.

#### Transition Adjustments
Throughout my time doing user reserach and as I worked on this last part, I tried to make my transitions and narrative more cohesive. I realized that there was a way to insert spacers, which is handy. I also tried to pare down the amount of words I used, while still capturing the essence of what I needed to communicate for the narrative to make sense.

#### Research on the Call to Action
My classmates had some great suggestions that would make my first item in the call to action more specific, so I dug into think tanks and foundations that might fund the collection of data on violence against women. Unfortunately I didn't find a lot, but I did uncover the fact that the World Health Organization and the United Nations are conducting a joint program to understand more about what data needs to be collected to help track and end violence against women globally. I linked to this in my call to action, although the program runs from 2018 to 2022 and has not yet published actual data, just recommendations for collecting it. The process made me curious about domestic violence in the U.S., so I researched what the U.S. government does about it. I was surprised that the Office for Violence Against Women had no published datasets on its prevalence, so I made that a note in my call to action for those who want something closer to home.


A few paragraphs that reflects on changes you made since the completion of Part II.  Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.  Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process. (Part III)

Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final project).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)

Add a link to your final data story (a direct link to Shorthand / StoryMap / etc.) placed in the final presentation spreadsheet.  Add the link next to your name in the spreadsheet, and update the title to reflect the working title for your presentation.  (Part III)

Include all references for materials used.  It's your responsibility to ensure you have permission to use imagery and other assets, and that you use them appropriately.  A reminder to NOT USE COPYRIGHTED MATERIAL - see the library's guide to ensure you are using images correctly.  Make sure to add / update any citations and / or other content that you used to create your data story.  Make sure you have cited external sources correctly.  References should also be clearly identified on your final data story itself.  Review the library's guide if you have questions.

Include any other information that helps round out your data story. (Part III)
