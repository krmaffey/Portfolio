# Visualizing Government Debt
In this assignment, we work with OECD data and a few types of visualizations to tell a story.

## OECD General Goverment Debt Data
We started with an OECD-generated visualization that shows the range of government debt as a percentage of their GDP. I chose to focus on 2016 because that was the year the Brexit referendum occurred as well as the year Donald Trump was elected, so I thought it would make an interesting time period to examine.[^1]
