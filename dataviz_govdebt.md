# Visualizing Government Debt
In this assignment, we work with OECD data and a few types of visualizations to tell a story.

## Web-based Visualization Tools and Data (Part 1)
We started with an OECD-generated visualization that shows the range of government debt as a percentage of their GDP. I chose to focus on 2016 because that was the year the Brexit referendum occurred as well as the year Donald Trump was elected, so I thought it would make an interesting time period to examine.<sup>[1](#note1)</sup>

## Analysis of Visualizations
All three of the above graphs are created with data from the OECD on general government debt. For ease of comparison, the data is translated to be a ratio of debt-to-GDP for each country, and it is sourced from [here](https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm). The first graph is very fun. I didn't find it particularly useful for making conclusions until I started editing it - that is, I found it to be too general to use for comparisons or analysis on its own. It is a lovely interactive tool that showcases a large amount of data easily, but isn't a graph that immediately lends itself to analytic conclusions.
Similarly, I found the grid of lines (second graph above) to be hard to grok. Yes it is very visually appealing, but I found myself wanting to make comparisons between countries or to understand more of how the OECD has changed over time, and neither of those things were easy to do. 
In the third graph, I wanted to show comparison. I immediately drifted towards a bar/column graph but those were not permitted for this assignment, so I started to explore other options.
