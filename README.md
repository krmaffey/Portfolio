# Portfolio
 This is a public collection of visualization projects that I'm developing as part of a CMU graduate course.
 
 
## About Me
I'm a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University focusing on data analytics and the implementation of emerging technologies, such as machine learning. My academic background is in social science, but I was exposed to the critical nature of parsing data during my first job after college. My experience there paired with other professional opportunities to exercise big-picture thinking led me to hone in on emerging technologies and policy as my areas of interest. Carnegie Mellon is a spectacular place to channel my passion into a concrete skillset, and I count myself very fortunate to be here.

In addition to my passion for emerging technology and policy, I am an avid reader of the Economist so I'm really looking forward to creating excellent graphics just like they do! I enjoy reading (nonfiction is my favorite), writing (I've made it a daily habit), and working out (particularly swimming and lifting). I sometimes dabble in photography, when the time (and light) is right.

Here's a picture I took in Pittsburgh during Fall 2020:

## What I Hope to Learn
While I care deeply about data-driven decisions (particularly at a strategic level), I have always found it challenging to appropriately portray data in a digestible way. Professionally, this has led me to default to very simple pictures or charts and then to do all the explaining verbally, or in a written format. However this is not always a possibility, and I especially struggled this past summer while working for a startup on a data-intensive project. I found myself wishing I had a better sense of color and structure and function when it came to the visualizations of our computational work.

I hope that my time in this course allows me to have a sense of how to construct a visualization with the appropriate color, typology, and story for any given context. I hope it makes me feel more comfortable when I go to design something, and that I can do so faster than I can right now. Once I graduate from CMU, I'll go back to working for the organization that is funding my degree.

### Data Visualization #1
In this assignment, we work with OECD data and a few types of visualizations to tell a story. Click [here](/dataviz_govdebt.md) to check it out!

### Critique by Design
This will be a masterful critique.

### Final Project (Part 1 of 3)
This will be the first installment of my final project.

### Final Project (Part 2 of 3)
This will be the second installment of my final project.

### Final Project (Part 3 of 3)
This will conclude my final project!
