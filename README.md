 This is a public collection of visualization projects that I'm developing as part of a CMU graduate course.
 
## About Me
I'm a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University focusing on data analytics and the implementation of emerging technologies, such as machine learning. My academic background is in social science, but I was exposed to the critical nature of parsing data while working after college. That paired with some experiences in big-picture thinking led me to hone in on emerging technologies and policy, particularly at a federal level. Carnegie Mellon is a spectacular place to channel my passion into a concrete skillset, and I count myself very fortunate to be here.

In addition to my passion for emerging technology and policy, here is a list of things I like in no particular order:
* Reading (nonfiction is my favorite)
* Writing (I've made it a daily habit)
* The Economist
* Working out (swimming, lifting)
* Photography

## What I Hope to Learn
While I care deeply about data-driven decisions (particularly at a strategic level), I have always found it challenging to appropriately portray the data in a digestible way. Professionally this has led me to default to very simple pictures or charts and then to do all the explaining verbally, or in a memo format. However this is not always a possibility, and I especially struggled this past summer while working for a startup. I found myself wishing I had a better sense of color and structure and function when it came to the visualizations of all the hard work we had done on a computational project.

I hope that my time in this course allows me to have a sense of what color and typology I should consider in certain circumstances. I hope it makes me feel more comfortable when I go to design something, and that I can do so in less time. Once I graduate from CMU, I'll be returning to my employer of 5 years who funded my degree.

This is where I'll put all of my projects!
