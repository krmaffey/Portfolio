# Final Project, Part 1
In this assignment, we laid out the structure and some ideas for our final projects.

## Project Outline
- A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.
- A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  

## Initial sketches
Sketches that outline your initial thoughts for your final project
Sketches should mimic aspects of your outline, and build on the resounding message you want to make clear through your project
Show both your anticipated data visualizations as well as major elements of your story itself (e.g key headers, etc.)

## Project Data
A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 
A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location.

## Method and Medium
In a few paragraphs, you should document how you plan on completing your final project.
